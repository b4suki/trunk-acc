DateSplicer
===========

DateSplicer adds the Dynarch calendar widget and a date parser to your Rails application as a fully integrated user control. Is a user friendly substitute for date_select field.

== Installation & Configuration

* Run "script/plugin install date_splicer" from within your application's root

* Include javascript files in application.html.erb:
    <%= javascript_include_tag 
          "calendar/calendar",
          "calendar/lang/calendar-parser-en",
          "calendar/lang/calendar-en",
          "calendar/calendar-parser",
          "calendar/calendar-setup" %>

* In your rhtml / erb views, do this: 
    <%= date_splicer :object_name, :method_name %>
  or this:
    <% form_for(@account) do |f| %>
      <%= f.date_splicer :start_date %>
      ...
    <% end %>
    
    
== How Does It Work?

In the background, DateSplicer parses your date into three parts (hence the name):

object_name[method_name({1,2,3}i)]

The default Rails date helpers deploy this mechanism as well.  This means DateSplicer is completely transparent to ActiveRecord. There is absolutely no need to adapt your models or controllers to DateSplicer.

It also means that DateSplicer can be used in conjunction with localization / globalization plugins such as Globalize. For instance, you could  use Globalize to set the date format used in DateSplicer. 

The widget's javascript files have their language specific settings consolidated in the "lang" directory.
